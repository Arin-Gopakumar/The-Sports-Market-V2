# üèÄ Sports Market Simulation System

A comprehensive Python system for simulating stock market-style trading of athletes based on their performance statistics.

## Overview

This system implements three core algorithms for the Sports Market concept:

1. **Base Price Algorithm** - Sets initial stock prices for rookies and non-rookies
2. **Intragame Simulation Algorithm** - Updates prices based on single game performance
3. **Timeframe/Season Algorithm** - Adjusts prices over weekly, monthly, or seasonal periods

## Features

- **Stored Player Data**: Pre-loaded game-by-game stats for Malik Monk, Devin Booker, and Miles McBride
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from base price, intragame, or timeframe simulations
- **Custom Input**: Input your own player stats for any simulation
- **Detailed Outputs**: See all intermediate calculations and final price changes
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly command-line interface

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main simulation system:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Available Options

1. **Base Price (Rookie/Non-Rookie)** - Calculate initial stock prices
2. **Intragame Simulation** - Update prices based on single game performance
3. **Timeframe/Season Simulation** - Adjust prices over time periods
4. **Custom Input** - Use your own player data
5. **Exit** - Quit the program

### Stored Players

The system includes detailed game-by-game data for:

- **Malik Monk** (2024-2025): 65 games with full stat tracking
- **Devin Booker** (2024-2025): 60 games with complete performance data
- **Miles McBride** (2024-2025): 65 games with comprehensive statistics

## Algorithm Details

### Base Price Algorithm

**Non-Rookie Players:**
- Uses PRS (Player Rating Score) based on league averages
- Calculates z-scores for each stat category
- Applies weighted formula: `Base Price = 10 + (PRS √ó 50)`
- Range: $10 - $60

**Rookie Players:**
- Uses DRS (Draft Rating Score) based on draft position
- Formula: `DRS = max(0.1, 1 ‚Äì log2(pick) / log2(60))`
- Base Price: `10 + (DRS √ó 25)`
- Range: $12.5 - $35

### Intragame Simulation Algorithm

1. **Input**: Actual game stats (PTS, REB, AST, TO, STOCKS, 3PM, TS%)
2. **Projected Stats**: `0.5 √ó Season Avg + 0.5 √ó Last 5 Games Avg`
3. **Z-Scores**: `(actual - projected) / std dev` (TO inverted)
4. **PPS**: Weighted z-score combination
5. **DIS**: Demand Imbalance Score calculation
6. **Price Change**: Dampened delta applied to current price

### Timeframe/Season Algorithm

**Timeframes:**
- **Weekly**: Past 4 games
- **Monthly**: Past 12 games  
- **Season**: Full season stats

**Process:**
1. Calculate projected stats per game based on timeframe
2. Compute actual averages over the period
3. Calculate z-scores and PPS
4. Apply timeframe-specific dampening rules
5. Update stock price
